### Hi.

`An Open Plan` is a project inspired by 
[a series of tweets](https://twitter.com/simonsarris/status/1260685417109696512?s=20), Andy Matuschak's note on [working with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu), John Carmack's [.plan pages](https://garbagecollected.org/2017/10/24/the-carmack-plan/) 
and Derek Siver's [now page](http://nownownow.com)

If you'd like to add yourself, please check out the about page. The idea is
to create a `/plan` page on the web, and post updates on your work there, as 
you're doing it.
