Hi!

Making things is a ton of fun, and sometimes watching other people make stuff
is even more fun! This is a collection of links to people making things in
public on the internet. Check out the About page for more information or add a
PR to have yourself listed in the plans!

##### What's the point?
I love seeing the stuff people are _making_ across the internet. Nothing is 
ever really finished, and little compares to being invited in to the process
of creation by someone who's doing the work. 

People all across the internet write and share their work, but it struck me that
we lacked a central place to create the scaffolding for discovery amongst 
ourselves so that we could find each others "garages". In the absence of another
place, I figured I'd just make something myself and see if it was useful :)

Feel free to email me at d@dmeh.net or submit a PR on 
[github](https://github.com/heimann/anopenplan) to add yourself to the list of 
pages if you want to share!
